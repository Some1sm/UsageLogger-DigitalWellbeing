  RD.XML (Roots) file for Native AOT.
  This file tells the AOT compiler to preserve types and their metadata
  even if they appear "unused" at compile time, which is essential for:
  - WinUI3Localizer (uses reflection to set Content/Text properties)
  - XAML Data Binding (requires property metadata)
  - System.Text.Json with polymorphism (if used)
